This article presents some lesson learned and basic principle on LIDAR data mapping.


** Input Lidar data
Cloud of points. Classified.


** Extracted layers

Raster data. Resolution 20cm, finest.

DSM
DTM
Vegetation
Buildings




** Mapping from vector data
Usual approach: Data capture, in raster format. Vectorisation, digitalisation, for



** Limitations - perspectives
Classification issues. Noise. Cranes. Birds. Cliffs classified as buildings. Statues classified as trees.
Poor semantic description.
Inconsistencies with auxiliary vector data - updating diffences.
